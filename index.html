	<h2>Education</h2><br>

	<p2>Northcote College</h2><br>
	<p3>2008 - 2012</p3><br>
	<p>I studied English, Maths, Physics, Music and Art Design.<br><br>
	<strong>Achievements</strong><br><br>
	Level 3 with Merit Endorsement.<br>
	The IT cup award for excellence in Information Technology.<br>
	My design was chosen for the school diary.<br>
	Principal's Award for creative writing.<br><br><br>


	<p2>Diploma Of Creative Advertising</p2><br>
	<p3>Media Design School</p3><br>
	<p3>2013</p3><br>
	<p>To do this course, students had to have an "ability to demonstrate a unique and insightful view of the world", and "proof of determination, problem solving, lateral thought, motivation
and most importantly, creativity."

I learnt many useful skills, including presenting ideas, copywriting, visual communication and techniques for generating ideas, while working on a range of projects that included
competitions and live client briefs.<br><br>

	<strong>Achievements</strong><br><br>
	I performed well in this course, creating the class-voted best idea of the
week a few time while working on my portfolio. Since I was without a partner for most of the end of year project time, I worked hard to generate and complete
my own ideas. 
<br><br>
3rd place in the NAB Newspaper awards (link).<br><br>



<p2>Web Bootcamp</p2><br>
	<p3>YooBee School of Design</p3><br>
	<p3>May - August 2014</p3><br>
	<p>This was a short intensive course that teaches everything
		needed to start web development. We completed a range
		of projects with HTML5, CSS3 & Javascript, while learning things like Git, Wordpress and Shopify. After touching on back-end languages and what they can do, I am continuing to learn Ruby on Rails.<br><br>

	<h2>Work Experience</h2>

	<p2>Internship at Contagion</p2><br>
	<p3>January - April 2014</p3><br>
	<p>I helped out with campaigns for clients including No1 Shoes,
the Comedy Festival, and the AA. The campaign I worked on the most was
for the AA. It was a facebook app people could use to vote for their favourite beach.
Along with my partner, I designed and wrote most of the content for it,
including all the Facebook ads to gather an audience. The campaign was quite popular, generating over 60,000 votes, and was featured on the TV3 News. You can watch the video <a href="http://www.3news.co.nz/Ohope-named-most-loved-beach/tabid/423/articleID/335648/Default.aspx">here.</a><br><br>

	<strong>What I Learnt</strong><br><br>
	<p> I learnt a lot about working in a real commercial environment, 
		and how projects happen from start to finish, as well as developing my ideation skills. A key idea I took away from here was how to simplify ideas and processes so the message is clear
		and concise. The highlight for me was seeing all the different elements that go into making an app,and watching the analytics of user interactions.
