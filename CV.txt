To do this course, students had to have an "ability to demonstrate a unique and insightful view of the world", and "proof of determination, problem solving, lateral thought, motivation
and most importantly, creativity."

I learnt about visual communication, techniques for generating ideas and copywriting, while working on a range of projects, including
competitions and live client briefs.


Achievements:

I performed well in this course, creating the class-voted best idea of the
week a few time while working on my portfolio. Since i was without a partner for most of this time, I worked hard to generate and complete
my own ideas.

including all the ads to gather an audience. The campaign was wuite popular, with other 60,000 votes, and was featured on the TV3
